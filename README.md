# Vision-Project-Image-Segmentation
Code for the Computer Vision project in Neural Networks.

The solution to task 1 is in the notebook Q1.ipynb and the created weights will be saved in a folder models1/ that should lie in the same directory in which Q1.ipynb will be executed.




The solution to task 3 are the script q3_train.py, which will train the models and store the trained model (multiple if the line to save weights per epoch will be uncommented) in a folder called models/, where we also provide a pretrained model.
The other Solution for task 3 is the script q3_eval.py, that loads the best model called "best.pt" that lies inside the folder models/ and computes the metrics on the validation set.
